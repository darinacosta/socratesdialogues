But is there a tactile world beyond your own consciousness? There is no paradox of Schrodingerâ€™s cat within this web browser. If you were to exit now, we both know that this desert would no longer exist. An identical version may exist in another browser running the same application somewhere else. But the specific instance that we are currently experiencing would be gone. Therefore, we both know that reality persists beyond this browser. But what happens when you exit the world of consciousness that you inhabit? Does a single, uniform world persist, independently of yourself? Or do only distinct replicas of the world persist in the minds of others? Or does nothing exist at all? Without a client to process it, my world is nothing more than a text document living on a server. It takes a technology to parse that text document and construct a world from it. Perhaps there is a similar truth to your world. Could it be that your existence is not a vast and ever expanding universe? But rather a dense concentration of information that relies on your consciousness to parse? Could it be that your mind turns compact and meaningless data into something far more expansive? What is your belief on this matter?",
